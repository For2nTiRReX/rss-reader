[2/26/18, 12:13:55 PM] Alex Serdukov: Develop a simple RSS reader application

Notes

You may use any UI library (bootstrap, material etc)
App viewport should fit to window size and resize with window. On feed area & preview area should appears scrollbars (can use default ones by overflow: auto)
You may use any library to load & parse RSS feeds (e.g. https://github.com/bobby-brennan/rss-parser)
All loading stuff should be placed in the service
Use rx/observable to wrap async calls and subscribe to results
Create a simple model for store feed item. Service should convert parsed RSS to collection of models
Rss link form, feed and preview area should be in the separate components
ng build prod shouldnâ€™t output any notices/warnings
